Statistical Data Analysis Reinforced Concrete Client Background Client: leading research institution middle Industry Type: Research Services: R&D Organization Size: 1000+ Project Objective Conducting statistical data analysis data provided types reinforced concrete (using 3 fibers – Steel, Date Polypropylene fibers) helping preparing research paper based laboratory data. Project Description project phase: Phase 1: phase, comprehensive analysis data finally build statistical models variables present. motive understand behaviour concrete based parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities concrete more. analysis include, limited to: Comparison Mo (control mix) mixes 28 days parameter test Comparing parameters specimens (all concrete mixes) 28 days 6 months heat-cool wet-dry expected analysis Phase 2: phase, develop structure research paper based results analysis. paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background objective), Experimental program ( materials methods), Results discussion ( analysis interpretation) Conclusion ( summary, insights remarks). Solution Providing Comprehensive analysis concrete data – showcasing insights based parameters (compressive strength, etc). basis results analysis, research paper drafted included deliverable. Project Deliverable manuscript (drafted article) following: Abstract Introduction ( literature, background objective) Experimental program ( materials methods) Results discussion ( analysis interpretation) Conclusion ( summary, insights remarks) References Tools Tools used: Jupyter – Notbebook (Python) Numpy Pandas Sklearn Matplotlib Seaborn MS Excel Google spreadsheets Language/techniques Python Statistical Modelling Statistical Inference Models Statistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential logarithmic models build showcasing behavior concrete mixes due mixing fiber content effect parameters above. Skills Coding – Python Performing statistical analysis – extracting inferences Building statistical models – python Excel counterparts. Databases database used. Web Servers server used. technical Challenges Faced Project Execution Challenges faced project execution are: statistical models seaborn libraries, direct models graphs created data. Building models excel validating (didn’t how, learn applying it). Technical Challenges Solved libraries building models, turned MS excel spreadsheet building models showcase data itself. this, learned build models aforementioned software YouTube blogs.
