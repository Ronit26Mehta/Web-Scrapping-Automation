Car Detection Satellite Images Client Background Client: leading retail firm Industry Type: Retail Services: Retail business Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective objective project detect cars satellite images highlight bounding box. Project Description client, Schneider, approached requirement develop Python project dealt computer vision. aim project detect cars present satellite image highlight bounding box. achieve this, decided Darknet model train Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. Solution Google Colab coding training Darknet model. Kaggle download Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. preprocessed dataset trained model it. model trained, tested satellite images worked perfectly fine. Finally, created script detected cars image highlighted bounding box. Project Deliverables final deliverable ipython Notebook presented Google Colab. Tools Google Colab, Kaggle, Slack(For Communication) Language/techniques Python Models Darknet(CV Model) Skills Python programming, AI/ML. technical Challenges Faced Project Execution challenge faced related pre-processing Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. dataset cleaned formatted training model. Technical Challenges Solved Python programming skills developed script automated pre-processing dataset. saved lot time allowed focus training model. Business Impact project success client happy final product. car detection model worked perfectly satellite images development application detect cars real-time.
