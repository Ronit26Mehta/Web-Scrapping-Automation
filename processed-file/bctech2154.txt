Project Description project task obtain account report detailed lead report specific dates customer_id Google Local Service Ads API Service Google Platform. integrate Google BigQuery database storing MCC data companies basis storing Historical data active companies. notifying clients email passing messages account data message format BaseCamp Message Campfire respective company projects API python programming, deploying script Heroku Server automating task. Creating BI Dashboard Data Studio connecting BigQuery Creating Live Dashboard, Historical Dashboard companies. historical data companies, Linear Regression Modelling perform create Modelling Dashboard companies Data Studio. Exploratory Data Analysis companies Historical Data. Store Customer Account Report message lead phone lead basis, Script created deployed Heroku store Historical data companies Finally Create Data Studio Dashboard it. Creating Representation Dashboard Companies involves multiple Reports blending multiple data sources Big Query. Solution >> Module 1: API Data Abstraction includes generation access token refresh token scope Google AdWord API authentication connecting Google LSA API. fetching data JSON format account based customer_id assigned API URL fetching data. Likewise generating script Handle data generation active accounts based customer id. >> Module 2: Data Imputation Storing Converting JSON data pandas data forming list data active accounts looping deriving attributes based handling missing inf values. Finally storing data Google Big Query database respective table accounts Bigquery API. >> Module 3: Data Storing BigQuery Notification Automation task automate notifications email Basecamp data transferred database basis deploying script Heroku Server setting time parameters based time zone. >> Module 4: Automation tools created till now: i. LSA_AccountReport_daily_BigQuery tool: Automation Account Report companies basis. Scheduling 1:00 Timezone. ii. LSA_AccountReport_Historical_API tool: Storing Historical Data companies Years till end date set. iii. Basecamp_lsa_automation: lsa data message format Campfire respective companies groups store lsa data combined companies Messageboard Campfire Automation Python Group Basecamp. iv. LSA_DateRange Tool: store missed data companies sets days months need. v. LSA_MainSheet_AutoUpdation tool: Auto updation sheet ‘LSA Client Lead’ Google Sheet. Data fetched basis list required auto update sheet companies entered store information company name, account id database name. vi. LSA_daily_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ basis. vii. Historical_LSA_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ storing historical data 2021. >> Module 5: Data Studio BI Dashboards Created: i. Historical Dashboard ii. Live Dashboard ii. Customer Report Dashboard iii. Modelling Report Dashboard iv. Representation Dashboard Project Deliverables Data Studio Dashboard Sheet Codes Deployed tools Modelling Test Purpose .

RAD model, attention paid planning priority development tasks. targets developing software span time. ● Advantages RAD Model: Changing requirements accommodated. Progress measured. Iteration time powerful RAD tools. Productivity fewer people time. Reduced development time. Increases reusability components. initial reviews occur. Encourages customer feedback. Integration beginning solves lot integration issues Skills ● API Data Abstraction ● Data Mining Statistical Modelling ● Data Wrangling ● Deployment Automation ● Data Visualization ● SQL ● Machine Learning ● Python Programming including OOPs Exception Handling Databases ● Google Firestore (Just Testing Purpose) ● Google BigQuery Web Servers Google BigQuery Database 1 TB storage used. technical Challenges Faced Project Execution ● Scheduling Automation Python Script. ● Data Exceptions Duplication BigQuery Tables. ● Refresh token Expiration 7 Days. ● Data Exception due Inactive companies Updation LSA sheet. ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue transferring Data multiple companies projects. ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due multiple account id. Technical Challenges Solved ● Scheduling Automation Python Script. Python Library BlockingScheduler Timezone variable ‘TZ’ set Heroku ● Data Exceptions Duplication BigQuery Tables. Structuring SQL Query database issues BigQuery solve issues. ● Refresh token Expiration 7 Days. Initially ‘Auth Playground’ generating Refresh token expired 7 Days longer refresh token generated Python script proper token endpoints headers defined generating refresh token. ● Data Exception due Inactive companies Updation LSA sheet. Data Exception occurred API data abstraction companies solved adding nested statements understanding issues ‘LSA Clients Lead’ sheet updated members due missed data companies solved creating script automatically update mainsheet error occurred. ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue transferring Data multiple companies projects. issue solved creating Basecamp sheet data fetched mapping account id fetched data LSA sheet project id basecamp companies. ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due multiple account id. Solved adding parameters setting metrics summation companies account id.
