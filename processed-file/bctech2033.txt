Dockerize AWS Lambda serverless architecture Client Background Client: leading tech firm Industry Type: & Consulting Products & Services: Solutions, Software Development Organization Size: 100+ Problem AWS Lambda, powerful serverless compute service, faces limitations terms runtime customization, dependency management, execution environment isolation. Solution overcome challenges mentioned above, propose comprehensive solution involves Dockerizing AWS Lambda functions improved flexibility, control, efficiency serverless architecture. Solution Architecture high-level architecture diagram: Components: AWS Lambda Function: original Lambda function code dependencies. Dockerfile: Describes steps build Docker image, including installing dependencies, copying Lambda function code, setting handler function. Docker Image: containerized version Lambda function, including code dependencies. Amazon ECR Repository: Stores Docker image. image tagged repository URI. Updated Lambda Function: Refers Docker image ECR repository. Lambda function configuration updated reference. Deliverables deliverables: Dockerfile: Dockerfile Lambda function project, instructions build Docker image. file includes base image, installation dependencies, copying Lambda function code, setting handler function. Docker Image: Docker image built Dockerfile. image encapsulates Lambda function code dependencies. Pushed Image ECR: Docker image pushed Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. involves tagging image ECR repository URI pushing repository. Updated Lambda Function Configuration: Lambda function configuration updated Docker image ECR. involve ECR URI Lambda configuration. Documentation: Documentation outlining steps Dockerize Lambda function push ECR. documentation include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, additional considerations. Tech Tools Docker Amazon ECR Amazon Lambda. AWS Management Console. Language/techniques NodeJS Docker commands Skills AWS services (Lambda, ECR, etc.). Docker Web Servers Amazon Web Services technical Challenges Faced Project Execution Dependency Management: Challenge: AWS Lambda imposes constraints runtime dependencies, making challenging manage control library versions. Execution Environment Isolation: Challenge: AWS Lambdaâ€™s managed environment lack runtime configurations isolation. Monitoring Logging Integration: Challenge: Efficiently capturing analyzing performance metrics logs Dockerized Lambda functions. Technical Challenges solved Dependency Management: Solution: containerization approach package dependencies Lambda function, providing control isolation. Implement robust dependency management system Docker container. Execution Environment Isolation: Solution: Docker containers offer enhanced isolation. Utilize containers encapsulate Lambda function dependencies, ensuring consistent execution environments. Monitoring Logging Integration: Solution: Integrate AWS CloudWatch basic monitoring.
