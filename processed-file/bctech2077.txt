Connecting MongoDB Database BI Dashboard: Dashboard Automation Client Background Client: leading tech firm Newzealand Industry Type: Retail Services: Retail business Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective Johnco MongoDB Database wanted connect BI Dashboard. However, ODBC connectors working level subscription, needed cheaper workaround. Project Description Johnco MongoDB Database amount data wanted visualize BI Dashboard. initially ODBC connectors connect database BI, ran issues due level subscription. brought find cheaper workaround. solution involved Python extract relevant data Brodie’s MongoDB Database. Pandas library create Dataframes, uploaded Azure Blob Storage tables. set Azure pipeline ran Python script 30 minutes update tables data database. Solution Brodie’s MongoDB Database extract relevant Data Clusters Pandas Dataframes. added tables Azure Blob Storage set Python script Azure pipeline refreshed 30 minutes. allowed data sync provide up-to-date information BI Dashboard. Project Deliverables final deliverable readable CSV file contained converted data original JSON format. Tools Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, BI, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel, Azure Blob Storage Language/techniques Python, Pandas, Azure Storage Skills Python programming, Azure Storage, data extraction manipulation Databases MongoDB Database Web Servers Azure Blob Storage technical Challenges Faced Project Execution challenge faced finding connect Brodie’s MongoDB Database BI Dashboard ODBC connectors. overcame challenge Python Azure Blob Storage extract store relevant data. Technical Challenges Solved solved issue client’s MongoDB Database extract relevant Data Clusters Pandas Dataframes. added dataframes tables Azure Blob Storage set Python script Azure pipeline refreshed 30 minutes. allowed client access data BI ODBC connectors. Business Impact solution allowed visualize data BI Dashboard pay expensive ODBC connectors. Azure Blob Storage solution implemented cost-effective provided up-to-date information 30 minutes.
