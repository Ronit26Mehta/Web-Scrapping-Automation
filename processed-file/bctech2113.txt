Electric Vehicles (EV) Load Management System Forecast Energy Demand Client Background Client: leading energy consulting firm Industry Type: Energy Services: Energy solutions, Consultancy Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective Create Machine learning solution manage electricity electric vehicles. Tasks: Percentage probability user plugin vehicle today user’s plugin date history Reduce probability plugin time user’s plugin time history Project Description calculate date time probability user plugin vehicle today based plugin date plugin time history. decrease time probability based user’s past time range. Solution converted user’s plugin data binary values 0 user hasn’t plugged-in vehicle 1 plugged-in. identified driven distance based amount charge plug-in times. trained Regression ML model identifying driven kilometer. kilometres identified probability user’s plug-in today increase till user plug-in vehicle. time probability Probability Distribution Function (PDF) Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). functions decrease probability user’s time range. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts to: Train regression model day. model weights generate probability values. Tools Google Colab, Code, Google Drive, MS Excel. Language/techniques Python programming language, Data Analytics numpy pandas, Data Visualization matplotlib, Statistics Mathematics, Machine learning SKlearn. Models Regression Model Skills Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Python, Statistics Databases local data MS Excel Sheet technical Challenges Faced Project Execution lot challenges faced project execution start, imaginary data convert format apply machine learning models. Find machine learning model data. Decrease time probability user’s time Technical Challenges Solved converted data weekday’s binary values marked 0 plugged-in vehicle 1 plugged calculated driven distance amount charge plugin dates. regression based machine learning models Random Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, Regression checked accuracies models choosed one. decreasing time probability Probability Distribution Function (PDF) Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). functions decrease probability user’s time range.
