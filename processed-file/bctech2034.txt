Design develop product recommendation engine based features products Client Background Client: leading retail firm Industry Type: Retail Products & Services: Retail Business, e-commerce Organization Size: 100+ Problem Design develop product recommendation engine based features products Solution Content-based product recommendation system created Machine Learning Algorithm Python. Solution Architecture Recommendation engine cases mentioned below: 1: Description: object PAR ID, inp_prodname recommends products object type input ranks based number specifications matched. Input: JSON format keys: Object Name, PAR ID, Debug Information, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: Object Name, Object Type, PAR ID, Rank, Specifications, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. 2: Description: specifications object type, inp_custom_spec recommends products ranks based number specifications matched. Input: JSON format keys: Specifications, Object Type, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: Object Name, Object Type, PAR ID, Rank, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. 3: Description: Based compatible models, inp_prodname_comp recommends products ranks based number compatible models matched. Input: JSON format keys: Object Name, PAR ID, Debug Information, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: Object Name, Object Type, PAR ID, Rank, Compatible Models, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. 4: Description: Based number specifications entered user, inp_spec_num creates clusters products number specifications. Input: JSON format keys: Number Specifications, Object Type, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: Cluster ID, Object Name, Object Types, PAR ID, specifications_grped, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. 5: Description: specification attributes object type, inp_spec_attr creates clusters products specifications. Input: JSON format keys: Specification Attributes, Object Type, Debug Information, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: PAR ID, Object Name, Object Type, Cluster ID, Specifications, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. 6: Description: Based object PAR ID entered user, inp_prodname_model creates clusters products similar specifications. Input: JSON format keys: Object Name, PAR ID, Debug Information, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. Output: JSON format keys: Object Name, Object Types, PAR ID, Specifications, Rank, userDef1, userDef2, userDef3. APIs cases created Deliverables code recommendation engine API delivered. Tools Python, Postman Language/techniques Python, Machine Learning, Flask API, Pandas Models Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm require predefined number clusters. group products based similarities. Skills Python, Logical Reasoning, Machine Learning, Data Engineering. technical Challenges Faced Project Execution Product features feature “product type” handled differently important product cluster product type. cases can’t solved machine learning algorithms. Technical Challenges Solved Handling Product Type Differentiating Feature: challenges faced dealing “product type” feature, required special consideration. crucial ensure products type grouped clustering recommendation algorithm. required developing specific approach address uniqueness product type feature incorporate effectively recommendation system. Custom modifications additional preprocessing steps needed accommodate requirement ensure accurate clustering based product type. Limitations Machine Learning Algorithms: machine learning algorithms powerful tools recommendation systems, cases sufficient solve challenges. project, discovered complex scenarios couldn’t adequately addressed traditional machine learning algorithms alone. overcome this, alternative techniques approaches scope standard algorithms needed explored. involve incorporating domain-specific rules, utilizing data analysis methods, hybrid models combine machine learning expert knowledge overcome limitations improve recommendation system’s performance. Business Impact recommendation engine significantly enhance customers’ shopping experience increasing likelihood discovering products perfectly align preferences. personalized approach saves valuable time effort searching relevant items ensures unique desires met. result, customers make purchases, leading increased revenue business. Moreover, recommendation engine plays crucial role improving customer satisfaction fostering long-term loyalty. suggesting products based individual preferences specific features, customers feel understood valued. tailored experience enhances satisfaction, making inclined return business future purchases. Additionally, satisfied customers spread positive word-of-mouth, attracting customers expanding customer base.
