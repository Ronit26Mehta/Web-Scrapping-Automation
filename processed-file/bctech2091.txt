agent-based model Virtual (VPP) Client Background Client: Leading Energy Firm Industry Type: Energy Services: Power, Energy, Distribution Organization Size: 5000+ Project Objective create agent based model virtual Netlogo. function multiple plants worked simultaneously. plants created supplied energy based demand parameter controlled observer Project Description client defined specific requirements wanted model be. requirements divided 4 parts. successive part increased complexity required model adjusted configured fit part entire model completed contained parts defined client Statement work. Solution Created model requirements. clustering multiple agents position decided mathematically based total number agents sum energies. agents form cluster based condition sum figure threshold amount, threshold amount decided observer. Project Deliverables https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Shingi-Samudzi-Build-Netlogo-ABM-for-simulating-Virtual-Power-Grid-economics github model delivered client. uploads start basic model clustering agents final upload model full representation VPP simulation. Tools -Netlogo – python Language/techniques Netlogo specific language resembles logo language it’s unique syntax variations variables stored list parsed Models Clustering Skills Netlogo programming technical Challenges Faced Project Execution challenge controlling behavior agent model. lack understanding language resources made challenging figure actual behavior agents model. decision decide agent cluster grid difficult primarily agent spawned random screen. meant agent spot form cluster agents. challenge deciding condition agents cluster relative distance couldn’t parameter wasn’t relevant model’s purpose. Technical Challenges Solved technical challenges solved extensive research referring forums span 2 months.
