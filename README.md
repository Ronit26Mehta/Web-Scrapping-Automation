## About the Project

This project automates the process of web scraping and applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques on the scraped content. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and automate text-based tasks such as:

- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

---

## Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extracts data from multiple websites based on predefined URLs or search terms.
- **NLP Techniques**: Includes Sentiment Analysis, Text Summarization, and NER.
- **Flexible Input/Output**: Supports various input types, providing detailed analysis and structured outputs.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Installing Dependencies

To install all required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

1. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook main.ipynb
     ```
   - The notebook will open in your default web browser.

2. **Select Web Scraping and NLP Options**:
   - Inside the notebook, configure the web scraping settings (URLs or keywords) and choose which NLP tasks to apply (Sentiment Analysis, Summarization, NER).

---

## Input Data

- **MasterDictionary**: Contains positive and negative word lists used for sentiment analysis.
- **StopWords**: Includes various stopword lists for filtering unnecessary words. Categories include:
  - Auditor
  - Currencies
  - Dates and Numbers
  - Generic stopwords
- **Processed Files**: Text files containing data that has been processed by the web scraping module.

---

## Web Scraping Logic

The web scraping module extracts data from the internet based on predefined URLs or search terms. The extracted content is cleaned and stored in the `processed-file/` directory for further analysis.

### Web Scraping Steps:
1. Open predefined URLs or perform keyword searches.
2. Extract the main content from each page.
3. Clean and save the scraped text data in the `processed-file/` directory.

---

## NLP Automation

Once the data has been scraped, the following NLP tasks are applied:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifies the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text.
2. **Text Summarization**: Condenses long text passages into shorter summaries.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects and classifies key entities, such as people, organizations, and locations.

The project utilizes pre-trained models and rule-based techniques to implement these NLP tasks.

---

## Results and Output

After running the project, the results are saved in the `results/` directory. The outputs include:

- **Sentiment Analysis Reports**: Sentiment scores for the scraped data.
- **Text Summaries**: Summaries of the extracted content.
- **NER Output**: Lists of recognized entities (e.g., names, locations).

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
