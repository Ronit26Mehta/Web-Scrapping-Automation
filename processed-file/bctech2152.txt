Sentimental Analysis Shareholder Letter Companies Client Background Client: leading financial firm Industry Type: Financial services & Consulting Services: Financial consultant Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective Project “Sentimental Analysis Shareholder Letter Companies” objective Predict Sentiments columns Shareholder Letter terms Polarity Subjectivity finally classification data positive, negative neutral tone. Project Description project ‘Sentimental Analysis Shareholder Letter Companies’ task involved data cleaning shareholder letters companies includes lemmatization, conversion, removing special character, \n , \t , punctuations, & single character tokenization. generate polarity subjectivity columns letter 1 & letter 2 columns Textblob library NLTK. Based polarity categorizing positive, neutral & negative. Solution Letter Text Length Variation Contraction mapping dataset Replacing missing neutral tone string cleaning doesn’t generate issue. Data Cleaning Preprocessing involves : i. Lemmatisation ii. conversion iii. Removing Special character iv. Removing \n , \t v. remove punctuations, & single character removal vi. forming list letter data tqdm Tokenization count. Textblob Library part NLTK Sentiment analysis. Created Polarity Subjectivity column Letter1 & Letter2 columns Based polarity letter 1 created letter1_type column values “positive” , “neutral” & “negative” category.
