## About the Project

This project is designed to automate the process of web scraping and then apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques on the scraped content. It aims to extract meaningful insights from web content and automate text-based tasks such as **sentiment analysis**, **text summarization**, and **entity recognition**.

---

## Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extract data from multiple websites based on predefined URLs or search terms.
- **NLP Techniques**: 
  - **Sentiment Analysis**
  - **Text Summarization**
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Flexible Input/Output**: Supports different input data types, with detailed analysis and structured outputs.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
    - Run the command:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```
    - The notebook will open in your web browser.

2. **Select the Web Scraping and NLP Options**: 
   - In the notebook, you can configure scraping options (URLs or keywords) and select the NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, summarization, etc.).

---

## Input Data

- **MasterDictionary**: Contains lists of positive and negative words for sentiment analysis.
- **StopWords**: A variety of stopword lists for filtering unnecessary words based on categories such as:
  - Auditor
  - Currencies
  - Dates and Numbers
  - Generic stopwords

- **Processed Files**: Text files representing the data that has been processed by the scraper for NLP tasks.

---

## Web Scraping Logic

The web scraping module fetches data from the internet based on predefined URLs or search terms. The content is saved as plain text and stored in the `processed-file/` directory for further NLP analysis.

### Steps:
1. Open URLs or perform searches.
2. Extract the body content from each webpage.
3. Save the cleaned text data in the `processed-file/` directory.

---

## NLP Automation

The project applies several NLP techniques on the scraped content, including:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (positive, negative, neutral).
2. **Text Summarization**: Automatically summarizes long pieces of text.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and classifies entities (such as people, organizations, locations) mentioned in the text.

These NLP tasks are powered by pre-trained models and rule-based techniques.

---

## Results and Output

After running the analysis, the results are stored in the `results/` directory. The output files include:
- Sentiment analysis reports
- Text summaries
- NER output, including a list of entities
