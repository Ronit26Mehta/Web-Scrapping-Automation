Design & Develop Question Answering model explanations visualization Client Background Client: Leading Tech Firm Industry Type: Consulting Services: Software, Consulting Organization Size: 100+ Project Description pre-trained question answering model create notebook explanations model’s working visuals bertviz, allennlp gradient values. Solution created notebook explained model model view view visuals bertviz library. similarity words easily find related words. allennlp library created bar charts heatmaps show higher attention words. finds question related words context higher words words related values. gradient based method show higher gradient values question text created bar charts text color charts show higher gradient values. Project Deliverables notebook explanation question answering model visualization. Tools Google colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Bertviz, Allennlp, Transformers Language/techniques Python programming language, Deep learning, NLP, Data Visualization Models Pretrained bert-base-uncased model distilbert model (both trained squad2 dataset) Skills Data visualization, Deep learning, NLP, python technical Challenges Faced Project Execution pre-trained model give results questions answers. working text data charts show differences higher attention attention words. Technical Challenges Solved pretrained Bert’s pretrained models distilbert(trained squad dataset), distilbert(trained squad2), base uncased, base. models one. solving charts related issues heatmap chart, bar chart dark colors text coloring method.
