Data Management Political SaaS Application Client Background Client: leading tech firm Industry Type: Services: SaaS, Products Organization Size: 100+ Problem guidelines discussion. Political Research Automated Data Acquisition (PRADA) phases included. 1. pics existing EOs (Elected Officials) 2. EOs Pictures. 3. Run QA checks regularly EOs 4. data government Facebook pages. 5. Geospatial project: Create version provided KML google earth. Creating nested directories contained description Map-URL designated location. 6. data States Counties(Including Boroughs Parishes) building automated generated structured data – programmer create config allowing bot scrap update data. Solution created automated python scripts designated phases respective requirements. Solutions type problems varied data scrapping automation python developed scripts including geospatial KML task. addition ranges data scrapped generated directed output respective tasks form CSV format. user’s aim requirement achieved i.e. programmer create con-fig initiate bot scrap required data. Solution Architecture majority task project consisted web data scraping automation high- level overview, specific implementation details project follows: Web Scraping Framework : Python coding language tasks framework data scraping included Beautiful-Soup, Selenium Web drivers. libraries provide tools functionalities navigate web pages, extract data, handle HTML elements. Data Extraction Parsing: selected web scraping library extract desired data web pages provided data sheet websites URLs sheet. involves locating HTML elements, applying filters selectors, parsing extracted data. Data Processing: data extraction cleansed, transformed aggregated structured form pandas’ Data CSV file. geospatial task resulted generation nested folders kml file. Data Storage: store scrapped data determined local file system form CSV (Comma Separated Values). data storage solution project. addition geospatial task output form kml file polygons inside directories nested folders. Deliverables Tasks Outputs (CSV/KML/XLSX) Python Scripts EOs mydata.csv Script1.py Script2.py Geospatial Task Electoral Districts.kml – Facebook Scrapping EOs EO_OUTPUT_O.csv final_eo_scrapping.py Facebook Scrapping 429 Cities Output_DRAFT_429_CITIES.csv Facebook_image_scrapping.py States Website URLs ScreenScrapingt.csv final_50_states_scrapping.py Counties Website URLs Website_final_write.xlsx county_scrapping.py Tools Python ( Programming Language ) Beautiful Soup Selenium Pandas Numpy Simplekml (regular expressions) Language/techniques Python ( Programming Language ) – interpreted language, prototyping interactive coding. versatility reasons applications. libraries tools project data solutions. Beautiful Soup – python library web scraping parsing HTML XML documents. convenient extract files. eases work flow parsing data extraction encoding handling well. Selenium – python library web browser automation Chrome, Firefox, Safari others. interacts elements clicking buttons, filling forms selecting drop options. project Chrome. Selenium web web automation. acted Python code Web browser. Pandas – Python’s versatile library performance data structure tools built top Numpy. Data feature due library used. feature efficient manipulation, slicing, filtering structured data Numpy – python library aka Numerical Python fundamental library scientific computing Python. Simplekml – python package enables generate KML effort possible. ( Regular Expressions): powerful tool python sued pattern matching manipulations strings. Skills Python Programming Web Fundamentals Web Scrapping libraries BS, Selenium. Data Cleaning Processing Problem- Solving debugging. KML structure handling Python’s programming. Databases None. structured data form python Data Frames, CSV Excel Sheets. technical Challenges Faced Project Execution Firstly web URLs accessible restricted IPs region Couldn’t fetch data Beautiful Soup couldn’t parse tags. List Counties wasn’t provided resource links Technical Challenges Solved VPN accessing Official generally accessible. Selenium Web automate direction URLs fetched complete html tags desired webpages. Performed search created structure data list counties input gain web URLs counties US. Business Impact Enhanced Analysis : Web scraping businesses gather valuable data websites. information provide insights desired aim objectives enabling businesses make informed. Real-Time Monitoring Upgradation: Web scraping enable business monitor updates website real-time. tracking regulatory changes. business it’s data updated. Increased Efficiency: Automation eliminated data collection, saving time resources. automated web scraping, business extract amount data quickly, accurately, improving operational efficiency.
