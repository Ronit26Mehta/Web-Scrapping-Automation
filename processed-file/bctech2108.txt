Incident Duration Prediction â€“ Infrastructure Estate Client Background Client: leading research institution middle Industry Type: Research Services: R&D Organization Size: 1000+ Project Objective complete Research Paper draft training Machine Learning models predict Incident Duration based parameters dataset summarising results. Project Description set researches, analyse compare machine learning deep learning models predict Incident Duration dataset. dataset contained durations durations. Build models set durations, compare all. Solution Here, predict traffic incident duration machine learning tools techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR Deep Learning algorithm tensor flow. models run Python Interpreter Deep learning model run studio, dataset compared models based (mean absolute error). Initially, preliminary analysis collected incident duration data, collect statistical characteristics variables research. Project Deliverables Python Script model. Documentation Research Work.
