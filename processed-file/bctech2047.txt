Solution Hub deliver ecosystem of: transformer model Distilled & tuned models OKR:s/KPI:s +domain data = “Book knowledge” + model = agents Ensembled models = teams delivered functions marketplace Voice interface, OpenAI Whisper transformer Multiple data types capturing information (DocArray) CLIP model mesh multiple data types vectors Neural Search function Generative function Automatic data labelling weight watcher tune model quality CPU/GPU cost Solution Architecture Automatic selection model tuning data corpus (book knowledge), performance. Add model API inference Unlike ChatGPT model don’t acknowledge making stuff creative ability. model doesn’t know, consult models joint predictions. Add function select ensembled models joint prediction step 4 occurs.
