Data integration big data performance Elasticsearch Client Background Client: Leading Tech Firm Industry Type: & Consulting Services: Software, Business Solutions, Consulting Organization Size: 200+ Project Objective Migrate existing databases Postgres elastic search Elasticserach performs search operations. addition this, backend javascript needed changed order query elasticsearch database. Project Description client’s website visualization tool. GUI add filters. make visualizations, 50,000 records needed pulled Postgres database size 200mbs. lot time (nearly 20-30 secs). Adding filters additional time. task move entire database Elasticsearch postgres faster search operations filtering data. database changed, write backend code query Elasticsearch database. Solution Setup ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) AWS EC2 instance. Write pipeline file (.conf file) ingest data postgres elasticsearch. datatypes cloumns, unique constraints, datetime formats etc., defined file. executed logstash. data inserted, queried kibana’s built query compiler. check veracity data. Identify code backend changed. Replace code code query elasticserach. elastic_query_builder module this. Testing Postgres Elasticsearch performance. Project Deliverables Setup ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) AWS EC2 instance. Pipeline i.e; logstash file working backend code elasticsearch Commands check elastic data. Customizable logstash pipeline Tools Elasticsearch Postman Kibana Logstash Python Javascript Amazon Web Services Postgres Docker Git Bucket Github Language/techniques Javascript Json Domain-Specific Language elasticsearch Skills Elasticsearch query knowledge Postgres query knowledge Networking Javascript Backend web Databases Postgres Elasticsearch Web Servers Amazon Web Services (AWS) technical Challenges Faced Project Execution responses elasticsearch ( size 500mb), time 30 secs. Technical Challenges Solved solve mentioned problem, gzip request url’s header. significantly reduced execution times. Business Impact Earlier postgres infrastructure 20-30 secs consistently 10 secs perform filter search operations. contribute user experience.
